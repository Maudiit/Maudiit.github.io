            'part1_exp' => 'The Italian regions of southern Tyrol, Haut-Adige and Veneto house some of the best via Ferrata in the world (literally "railway" in French).These mountain roads are equipped with fixed ladders, steel cables, anchoring points and suspension bridges offering access to climbers and hikers in good physical shape, but not necessarily having great experienceIn the placement of mobile protective equipment such as straps, friends and jammers, or in the process or management of the rope.But although via ferrata do not present the risks associated with climbing without protection, some of them lead to the top of high massifs and require some experience.The first via Ferrata de Cortina d\'ampezzo, Ra Šàra del Minighèl (the minighel scale), is one of the oldest of the Dolomites.Created by a local blacksmith in 1907, it was 80 meters above an apparent rocky wall in Majarié (El Souta del Majarié) in the Val Travenanzes region.This region was also the land of some of the most intense battles of the First World War, during which via ferrata were used for the movement and supply of troops along the Italian-Austrian border.There are still many ruins, trenches, caves and tunnels dug by soldiers.',

            'part1_exp' => 'For many, the indoor climbing is self-sufficient.In reality, it is that the starting point for an adventure.Indoor facilities offer an environment conducive to training, but climbing is an outside sport where other factors come into play, such as rope management, weather conditions, theethics, the nature of rock and natural environments.',
            'part2_exp' => 'In most cases, sports climbing outdoors requires a first rope.This placed shoes (two unlocked carabiners connected by canvas) in pre-positioned ankles along the road, clips the rope during the ascent and creates an anchoring point at the top.In certain outdoor climbing sectors, it is also possible to climb to the top of the anchor point, place the rope and then go on a reel on the road.We also recommend that we learn to equip an anchoring point with an anchor of reel.The reel is a good way to make block sequences or make lengths in order to acquire aerobic endurance.Rather than emphasizing the destination or arriving at the top, the sport climbing mainly requires movements of high intensity and puts the accent on the physical appearance or the difficulty presented by the climb.Sports climbing can be practiced on ways of length, ensured from the ground, or multi-length pathways.',

            'part3_exp' => 'In this sense, trad climbers today use removable protections such as riding jackets, nuts, bicoins or hexagonal, which are placed in cracks or holes.The tracks therefore do not include fixed platelets allowing the installation of quickdraws, which makes it possible not to distort/damage the cliffs. ',
            'part4_exp' => 'For this reason, many climbers and mountaineers consider trad as the type of ultimate climbing, because it implies total autonomy on a path.No question of counting on anchors or pre-plaice equipment to protect yourself. ',
